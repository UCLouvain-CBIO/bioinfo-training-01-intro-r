**Learning Objectives**

- Describe the purpose of the **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`** packages.

- Describe several of their functions that are extremely useful to manipulate data.

- Describe the concept of a wide and a long table format, and see how to
reshape a data frame from one format to the other one.


## Data Manipulation using **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**

Bracket subsetting is handy, but it can be cumbersome and difficult to
read, especially for complicated operations. 

Some packages can greatly facilitate our task when we manipulate data.
Packages in R are basically sets of additional functions that let you
do more stuff. The functions we've been using so far, like `str()` or
`data.frame()`, come built into R; Loading packages can give you access to other
specific functions. Before you use a package for the first time you need to install
it on your machine, and then you should import it in every subsequent
R session when you need it. 

- The package **`dplyr`** provides powerful tools for data manipulation tasks. 
It is built to work directly with data frames, with many manipulation tasks
optimized.

- As we will see latter on, sometimes we want a data frame to be reshaped to be able 
to do some specific analyses or for visualization. The package **`tidyr`** addresses
this common problem of reshaping data and provides tools for manipulating 
data in a tidy way.

To learn more about **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`** after the workshop,
you may want to check out this [handy data transformation with
**`dplyr`**
cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf)
and this [one about
**`tidyr`**](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf).

- The **`tidyverse`** package is an "umbrella-package" that installs
several useful packages for data analysis which work well together,
such as **`tidyr`**, **`dplyr`**, **`ggplot2`**, **`tibble`**, etc.
These packages help us to work and interact with the data. 
They allow us to do many things with your data, such as subsetting, transforming, 
visualizing, etc.

To install and load the **`tidyverse`** package type:

```{r eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("tidyverse")
```

```{r, message = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
## load the tidyverse packages, incl. dplyr
library("tidyverse")
```


## Loading data with tidyverse

Instead of `read.csv()`, we will read in our data using the `read_csv()` function, from the
tidyverse package **`readr`**, .


```{r, message = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
rna <- read_csv("data/rnaseq.csv")

## view the data
rna
```

Notice that the class of the data is now referred to as a "tibble". 

Tibbles tweak some of the behaviors of the data frame objects we introduced in the 
previously. The data structure is very similar to a data frame. For our purposes 
the only differences are that:

1. It displays the data type of each column under its name.
Note that <`dbl`> is a data type defined to hold numeric values with 
decimal points. 

2. It only prints the first few rows of data and only as many columns as fit on 
one screen. 
   
We are now going to learn some of the most common **`dplyr`** functions:

- `select()`: subset columns
- `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
- `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other columns
- `group_by()` and `summarize()`: create summary statistics on grouped data
- `arrange()`: sort results
- `count()`: count discrete values

## Selecting columns and filtering rows

To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The first argument
to this function is the data frame (`rna`), and the subsequent
arguments are the columns to keep.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
select(rna, gene, sample, tissue, expression)
```

To select all columns *except* certain ones, put a "-" in front of
the variable to exclude it.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
select(rna, -tissue, -organism)
```

This will select all the variables in `rna` except `tissue`
and `organism`.

To choose rows based on a specific criteria, use `filter()`:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
filter(rna, sex == "Male")
filter(rna, sex == "Male" & infection == "NonInfected")
```

## Pipes

What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three
ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.

With intermediate steps, you create a temporary data frame and use
that as input to the next function, like this:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna2 <- filter(rna, sex == "Male")
rna3 <- select(rna2, gene, sample, tissue, expression)
rna3
```

This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of intermediate objects 
that you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that can be hard to keep track of.

You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another), like this:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna3 <- select(filter(rna, sex == "Male"), gene, sample, tissue, expression)
rna3
```

This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested, as
R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case, filtering, then selecting).

The last option, *pipes*, are a recent addition to R. Pipes let you take
the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful
when you need to do many things to the same dataset.  

Pipes in R look like `%>%` and are made available via the **`magrittr`** package, 
installed automatically with **`dplyr`**. If you use RStudio, you can type the pipe with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
+ <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a PC or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> +
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a Mac.

In the above code, we use the pipe to send the `rna` dataset first through
`filter()` to keep rows where `sex` is Male, then through `select()`
to keep only the `gene`, `sample`, `tissue`, and `expression`columns. 

The pipe `%>%` takes the object on its left and passes it directly as the first 
argument to the function on its right, we don't need to explicitly include the data frame 
as an argument to the `filter()` and `select()` functions any more.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>% 
  filter(sex == "Male") %>% 
  select(gene, sample, tissue, expression)
```


Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word "then". For instance,
in the above example, we took the data frame `rna`, *then* we `filter`ed
for rows with `sex == "Male"`, *then* we `select`ed columns `gene`, `sample`, 
`tissue`, and `expression`. 

The **`dplyr`** functions by themselves are somewhat 
simple, but by combining them into linear workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish
more complex manipulations of data frames.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data, we
can assign it a new name:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna3 <- rna %>% 
  filter(sex == "Male") %>% 
  select(gene, sample, tissue, expression)

rna3
```

Note that the final data frame is the leftmost part of this expression.


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Using pipes, subset the `rna` data to genes with an expression higher 
than 50000 in female mice at time 0, and retain only the columns `gene`, 
`sample`, `time`, `expression` and `age`

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r, eval=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
rna %>%
  filter(expression > 50000, sex == "Female", time == 0 ) %>%
  select(gene, sample, time, expression, age)
```

`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


## Mutate

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing
columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the ratio of values in two
columns. For this we'll use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of time in hours:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>%  
  mutate(time_hours = time * 24) %>% 
  select(time, time_hours) 
```

You can also create a second new column based on the first new column within the same call of `mutate()`:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>%  
  mutate(time_hours = time * 24, time_mn = time_hours * 60) %>% 
  select(time, time_hours, time_mn) 
```


Now let's imagine we are interested in the human homologs of the mouse 
genes analysed in this dataset. This information can be found in the 
last column of the `rna` tibble, named `hsapiens_homolog_associated_gene_name`.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>% 
  select(gene, hsapiens_homolog_associated_gene_name)
```

Some mouse gene have no human homologs. These can be retrieved using a `filter()` 
in the chain, and the `is.na()` function that determines whether something is an `NA`.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>% 
  select(gene, hsapiens_homolog_associated_gene_name) %>% 
  filter(is.na(hsapiens_homolog_associated_gene_name))
```

If we want to keep only mouse gene that have a human homolog, we can insert a "!"
symbol that negates the result, so we're asking for every row where 
hsapiens_homolog_associated_gene_name *is not* an `NA`.

The first few rows of the output are full of `NA`s, so if we wanted to remove
those we could insert a `filter()` in the chain:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>% 
  select(gene, hsapiens_homolog_associated_gene_name) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(hsapiens_homolog_associated_gene_name))
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Create a new data frame from the `rna` data that meets the following criteria: 
contains only the `gene`, `chromosome_name`, `phenotype_description`, `sample`, and `expression` columns and a new
column giving the log expression the gene.
This data frame must only contain gene located on autosomes and associated with a phenotype_description.

**Hint**: think about how the commands should be ordered to produce
this data frame!
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`
```{r, eval=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
rna %>% 
  filter(chromosome_name != "X", chromosome_name != "Y") %>%
  mutate(log_expression = log(expression)) %>% 
  select(gene, chromosome_name, phenotype_description, sample, log_expression) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(phenotype_description))
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


## Split-apply-combine data analysis

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the
*split-apply-combine* paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some
analysis to each group, and then combine the results. **`dplyr`**
makes this very easy through the use of the `group_by()` function.

```{r}
rna %>%
  group_by(gene)
```

The `group_by()` function doesn't perform any data processing, it
groups the data into subsets: in the example above, our initial
`tibble` of `r nrow(rna)` observations is split into
`r length(unique(rna$gene))` groups based on the `gene` variable.


We could similarly decide to group the tibble by the samples:

```{r}
rna %>%
  group_by(sample)
```

Here our initial `tibble` of `r nrow(rna)` observations is split into
`r length(unique(rna$sample))` groups based on the `sample` variable.

Once the data have been combined, subsequent operations will be
applied on each group independently.


### The `summarize()` function

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()`, which
collapses each group into a single-row summary of that group.

`group_by()` takes as arguments the column names that contain the
**categorical** variables for which you want to calculate the summary
statistics. So to compute the mean `expression` by gene:

```{r}
rna %>%
  group_by(gene) %>%
  summarize(mean_expression = mean(expression))
```

We could also want to calculate the mean expression levels of all genes in each samples:

```{r}
rna %>%
  group_by(sample) %>%
  summarize(mean_expression = mean(expression))
```

But we can can also group by multiple columns:

```{r}
rna %>%
  group_by(gene, infection, time) %>%
  summarize(mean_expression = mean(expression))
```

Once the data is grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at the same
time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance, we could add
columns indicating the median `expression` by gene and by condition:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>%
  group_by(gene, infection, time) %>%
  summarize(mean_expression = mean(expression),
            median_expression = median(expression)) 
```

It is sometimes useful to rearrange the result of a query to inspect the values. 
For instance, we can sort on `mean_expression` to put the genes lowly expressed first:


```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>%
  group_by(gene, infection, time) %>%
  summarize(mean_expression = mean(expression),
            median_expression = median(expression)) %>% 
  arrange(mean_expression)
```

To sort in descending order, we need to add the `desc()` function:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>%
  group_by(gene, infection, time) %>%
  summarize(mean_expression = mean(expression),
            median_expression = median(expression)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_expression))
```


### Counting

When working with data, we often want to know the number of observations found
for each factor or combination of factors. For this task, **`dplyr`** provides
`count()`. For example, if we wanted to count the number of rows of data for
each infected and non infected samples, we would do:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>%
    count(infection)
```

The `count()` function is shorthand for something we've already seen: grouping by a variable, and summarizing it by counting the number of observations in that group. In other words, `rna %>% count()` is equivalent to:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna %>%
    group_by(infection) %>% 
    summarise(n = n())
```


Previous example shows the use of `count()` to count the number of rows/observations
for *one* factor (i.e., `infection`).
If we wanted to count *combination of factors*, such as `infection` and `time`,
we would specify the first and the second factor as the arguments of `count()`:

```{r purl = FALSE}
rna %>%
    count(infection, time)
```

which is equivalent to this:

```{r purl = FALSE}
rna %>%
  group_by(infection, time) %>% 
  summarize(n = n())
```

We can use `arrange()` to sort the table, to facilitate the comparisons.
For instance, we might want to arrange the table above by time:

```{r purl = FALSE}
rna %>%
  count(infection, time) %>%
  arrange(time)
```

or by counts:

```{r purl = FALSE}
rna %>%
  count(infection, time) %>%
  arrange(n)
```



`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

1. How many genes were analysed in each sample? 

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r, purl=FALSE}
rna %>%
  count(sample) 
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

2. Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to evaluate the sequencing depth 
(the sum of all counts) in each sample. Which sample has the highest sequencing depth? 

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r, purl=FALSE}
rna %>%
  group_by(sample) %>% 
  summarize(seq_depth = sum(expression)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(seq_depth))
```

`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

3. Calculate the mean expression level of gene "Dok3" by timepoints.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r, purl=FALSE}
rna %>% 
  filter(gene == "Dok3") %>% 
  group_by(time) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(expression)) %>% 
  arrange(time)
```

`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

4. Pick one sample and evaluate the number of genes by biotype 

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r, purl=FALSE}
rna %>%
  filter(sample == "GSM2545336") %>% 
  group_by(gene_biotype) %>% 
  count(gene_biotype) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

5. Identify genes associated with "abnormal DNA methylation" phenotype description, 
   and calculate their mean expression (in log) at time 0, time 4 and time 8.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r, purl=FALSE}
rna %>%
  filter(phenotype_description == "abnormal DNA methylation") %>% 
  group_by(gene, time) %>% 
  summarize(mean_expression = mean(log(expression))) %>% 
  arrange()
```  

`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`



## Reshaping data

In the `rna` tibble, the rows contain expression values (the unit) that are
associated with a combination of 2 other variables: `gene` and `sample`.

All the other columns correspond to variables describing either
the sample (organism, age, sex,...) or the gene (gene_biotype, ENTREZ_ID, product...).
The variables that don’t change with genes or with samples will have the same value in all the rows.

   
```{r}
rna %>%
  arrange(gene) 
```  



This structure is called a `long-format`, as one column contains all the values,
and other column(s) list(s) the context of the value.

In certain cases, the `long-format` is not really "human-readable", and another format,
a `wide-format` is preferred, as a more compact way of representing the data.
This is typically the case with gene expression values that scientists are used to
look as matrices, were rows represent genes and columns represent samples.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
rna %>% 
  select(gene, sample, expression) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sample,
              values_from = expression)
```  

To convert the gene expression values from `rna` into a wide-format,
we need to create a new table where each row (the units) is composed
of expression values associated with each gene. 

In practical terms this means the values of the `sample` column in `rna` would 
become the names of column variables, and the cells would contain the expression 
values measured on each gene.

The key point here is that we are still following
a tidy data structure, but we have **reshaped** the data according to
the observations of interest: expression levels per gene instead
of recording them per gene and per sample.

With this new table, it would become therefore straightforward 
to explore the relationship between the gene expression levels within, and
between, the samples. 



The opposite transformation would be to transform column names into
values of a new variable.

We can do both these of transformations with two `tidyr` functions,
`pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` (see
[here](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html) for
details).

### Pivoting the data into a wider format

Let's first select the 3 first columns of `rna` and use `pivot_wider()` 
to transform data in a wide-format.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna_exp <- rna %>% 
  select(gene, sample, expression)
rna_exp
```

`pivot_wider` takes three main arguments:

1. the data to be transformed;
2. the `names_from` : the column whose values will become new column
   names;
3. the `values_from`: the column whose values will fill the new
   columns.

![](./figs/pivot_wider.png)

Note also the `values_fill` argument which, if set, fills in missing
values with the value provided.

Using `pivot_wider()`, using new columns from the `sample` variable and
values from `expression`, this becomes 1474 gene expression measurements of 22
variables, one row for each gene, one column for each sample. We again use pipes:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna_wide <- rna_exp %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sample,
              values_from = expression)
rna_wide
```







We can now easily plot the comparisons between the gene expression levels
in different samples.

Note that the `pivot_wider()` function comes with an optional `values_fill` argument
that can be usefull when dealing with missing values.
Let's imagine that for some reason, we had some missing expression values for some 
genes in certain samples. In the following fictive example, the gene Cyp2d22 has only
one expression value, in GSM2545338 sample.


```{r, purl = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
rna_with_missing_values <- rna %>% 
  select(gene, sample, expression) %>% 
  filter(gene %in% c("Asl", "Apod", "Cyp2d22")) %>% 
  filter(sample %in% c("GSM2545336", "GSM2545337", "GSM2545338")) %>% 
  arrange(sample) %>% 
  filter(!(gene == "Cyp2d22" & sample != "GSM2545338"))
```

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna_with_missing_values
```

By default, the `pivot_wider()` function will add `NA` for missing values.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna_with_missing_values %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sample,
              values_from = expression)
```

But in some cases, we may wish to fill in the missing values by setting `values_fill` 
to a specific value.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
rna_with_missing_values %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sample,
              values_from = expression,
              values_fill = 0)
```



### Pivoting data into a longer format

In the opposite situation we are using the column names and turning them into
a pair of new variables. One variable represents the column names as
values, and the other variable contains the values previously
associated with the column names.

`pivot_longer()` takes four main arguments:

1. the data to be transformed;
2. the `names_to`: the new column we wish to create and populate with the
   current column names;
3. the `values_to`: the new column we wish to create and populate with
   current values;
4. the names of the columns to be used to populate the `names_to` and
   `values_to` variables (or to drop).
   
![](./figs/pivot_longer.png)   

To recreate `rna_long` from `rna_long` we would create a key
called `sample` and value called `expression` and use all columns
except `gene` for the key variable. Here we drop `gene` column
with a minus sign.

Notice how the new variable names are to be quoted here. 

```{r}
rna_long <- rna_wide %>%
    pivot_longer(names_to = "sample",
                 values_to = "expression",
                 -gene)
rna_long
```







Note that if we had missing values in the wide-format, the `NA` would be 
included in the new long format. Pivoting to wider and longer formats can 
be a useful way to balance out a dataset so every replicate has the same composition.

```{r}
wide_with_NA <- rna_with_missing_values %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sample,
              values_from = expression)
wide_with_NA

wide_with_NA %>%
    pivot_longer(names_to = "sample",
                 values_to = "expression",
                 -gene)
```


We could also have used a specification for what columns to
include. This can be useful if you have a large number of identifying
columns, and it's easier to specify what to gather than what to leave
alone. Here the `starts_with()` function can help to retrieve sample
names without having to list them all!
Another possibility would be to use the `:` operator!

```{r}
rna_wide %>%
    pivot_longer(names_to = "sample",
                 values_to = "expression",
                 cols = starts_with("GSM"))
rna_wide %>%
    pivot_longer(names_to = "sample",
                 values_to = "expression",
                 GSM2545336:GSM2545380)
```


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Subset genes located on X and Y chromosomes from the `rna` data frame and 
spread the data frame with `sex` as columns, `chromosome_name` as
rows, and the mean expression of genes located in each chromosome as the values,
as in the followinf tibble. 

![](./figs/Exercise_pivot_W.png)   

You will need to summarize before reshaping!

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

Let's have a look to variables of interest 

```{r, answer=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
rna %>% 
  filter(chromosome_name == "Y" | chromosome_name == "X") %>% 
  select(gene, sample, sex, expression, chromosome_name) %>% 
  arrange(gene)
```

Let's calculate the mean expression level of X and Y linked genes from male and female samples...

```{r}
 rna %>% 
  filter(chromosome_name == "Y" | chromosome_name == "X") %>% 
  group_by(sex, chromosome_name) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(expression))
```

And pivot the table to wide format

```{r, answer=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
rna_1 <- rna %>% 
  filter(chromosome_name == "Y" | chromosome_name == "X") %>% 
  group_by(sex, chromosome_name) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(expression)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex,
              values_from = mean)

rna_1
```

`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Now take that data frame and transform it with `pivot_longer()` so
each row is a unique `chromosome_name` by `gender` combination.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r, answer=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
rna_1 %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "gender",
               values_to = "mean",
               - chromosome_name)

```

`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Use the `rna` dataset to create an expression matrix were each row represents
the mean expression levels of genes and columns represent the different timepoints. 

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r}
rna %>% 
  group_by(gene, time) %>% 
  summarize(mean_exp = mean(expression)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = time,
              values_from = mean_exp)
```

Notice that this generates a tibble with some column names starting by a number.
If we wanted to select the column corresponding to the timepoints,
we could not use the column names directly... What happens when we select the colum 4?

```{r}
rna %>% 
  group_by(gene, time) %>% 
  summarize(mean_exp = mean(expression)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = time,
              values_from = mean_exp) %>% 
  select(gene, 4)
```

To select the timepoint 4, we would have to quote the column name, with backticks "`"

```{r}
rna %>% 
  group_by(gene, time) %>% 
  summarize(mean_exp = mean(expression)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = time,
              values_from = mean_exp) %>% 
  select(gene, `4`)
```

Another possibility would be to rename the column, 
choosing a name that doesn't start by a number :

```{r}
rna %>% 
  group_by(gene, time) %>% 
  summarize(mean_exp = mean(expression)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = time,
              values_from = mean_exp) %>% 
  rename("time0" = `0`, "time4" = `4`, "time8" = `8`) %>% 
  select(gene, time4)
```


`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Use the previous data frame containing mean expression levels per timepoint and create 
a new column containing fold-changes between timepoint 8 and timepoint 0, and fold-changes 
between timepoint 8 and timepoint 4.
Convert this table in a long-format table gathering the foldchanges calculated.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r}
rna_FC <- rna %>% 
  group_by(gene, time) %>% 
  summarize(mean_exp = mean(expression)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = time,
              values_from = mean_exp) %>% 
  mutate(time_8_vs_0 = `8` / `0`, time_8_vs_4 = `8` / `4`) 
rna_FC
```

```{r}
rna_FC %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "comparisons",
               values_to = "Fold_changes",
               time_8_vs_0:time_8_vs_4)
```

`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


## Exporting data

Now that you have learned how to use **`dplyr`** to extract information from
or summarize your raw data, you may want to export these new data sets to share
them with your collaborators or for archival.

Similar to the `read_csv()` function used for reading CSV files into R, there is
a `write_csv()` function that generates CSV files from data frames.

Before using `write_csv()`, we are going to create a new folder, `data_output`,
in our working directory that will store this generated dataset. 

We don't want to write generated datasets in the same directory as our raw data. 
It's good practice to keep them separate. 

The `data` folder should only contain the raw, unaltered data, and should be left 
alone to make sure we don't delete or modify it. 

In contrast, our script will generate the contents of the `data_output`
directory, so even if the files it contains are deleted, we can always
re-generate them.

In preparation for our next lesson on plotting, we are going to prepare a
table representing for each gene, the fold-changes (in log values) between timepoint 8 
and timepoint 0, and the fold-changes between timepoint 8 and timepoint 0. 


```{r}
rna_FC <- rna %>%
  mutate(expression_log = log(expression)) %>% 
  select(gene, time, gene_biotype, expression_log) %>% 
  group_by(gene, time, gene_biotype) %>%
  summarize(mean_exp = mean(expression_log)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = time,
              values_from = mean_exp) %>%
  mutate(time_8_vs_0 = `8` - `0`, time_4_vs_0 = `4` - `0`) 

rna_FC
```

We can save the table as a CSV file in our `data_output`
folder.

```{r, purl=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
write_csv(rna_FC, file = "data_output/rna_FC.csv")
```
