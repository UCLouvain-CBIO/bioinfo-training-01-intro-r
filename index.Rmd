# Preamble {-}

## Training aims {-}

*Do you want to get started with reproducible data analysis with R, one of the most used software for the analysis of high throughput biology data?*

R is a free and open-source software. It is one of the most widely used in the bio-medical research field, likely due to the availability of numerous R/Bioconductor packages specifically dedicated to high throughput data.

The goal of this training is to initiate wet-lab scientists to reproducible data analysis with R and its RStudio integrated environment, focusing on data manipulation, data visualisation and basic data analysis.

## Pre-requisites {-}

This training doesnâ€™t require any previous knowledge of R. There are no programming or technical pre-requisities for this course, other than basic computer usage, such as general knowledge about files (binary and text files) and folders and as well as downloading files. Familiarity with a spreadsheet editor is helpful for the first
chapter.

## Content {-}

* Discovering R, and the RStudio environment
* Importance of tidy data in general and how it translates into dataframes in R
* Data manipulation and analysis using R standard commands and the tidyverse packages
* Data visualisation with ggplot2

## Requirements {-}

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. They should have a few specific software packages installed:

* Download R from the CRAN page: https://cloud.r-project.org/. At the top of that page, choose the Download R link corresponding to your operating system. If you use Windows, follow install R for the first time, then click the link to download R. The installation procedure is like any other software, and you can safely use all default options. If you use Mac (OS X), download the pkg installer that matches you OS version and install like any other software. Linux users are advised to use their package manager.

* Download and install the Rstudio Desktop Open source edition: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download. Choose the installer for your operating system and version. Install as any other software.

## References and credits {-}

References are provided throughout the course. Several stand out
however, as they cover large parts of the material or provide
complementary resources.

The material for the first chapters, covering the *Introduction to
data science with R*, is based on the [**Data Carpentry** Ecology
curiculum](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop) [@DCRecol].

General references for this course are *R for Data Science*
[@r4ds:2017] and *Bioinformatics Data Skills* [@Buffalo:2015].

The [RStudio Cheat
Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are also a
handy resource and readers will be pointed to specific sheets in the
respective chapters.

This training is organised by the SMCS in partnership with laurent
Gatto, from the [CBIO Lab](https://lgatto.github.io/cbio-lab/) in the
de Duve Institute and is being taught by Axelle Loriot and Manon
Martin at the UCLouvain, Belgium.


## About this course material {-}

This material is written in R markdown [@R-rmarkdown] and compiled as
a book using `knitr` [@R-knitr] `bookdown` [@R-bookdown]. The source
code is publicly available in a Github repository
[https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/bioinfo-training-01-intro-r](https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/bioinfo-training-01-intro-r)

## Setup {-}

For chapter \@ref(sec-dataorg) about *Data organisation with
Spreadsheets*, a spreadsheet programme is necessary.

We will be using the [R environment for statistical
computing](https://www.r-project.org/) as main data science language.
We will also use the
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) interface to
interact with R and write scripts and reports. Both R and RStudio are
easy to install and works on all major operating systems.

Once R and RStudio are installed, a set of packages will need to be
installed. See section \@ref(sec-setup2) for details.
